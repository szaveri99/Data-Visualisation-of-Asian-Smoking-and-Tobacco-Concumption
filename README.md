## Overview

This project aims to provide insights into tobacco-related data from Asian countries. It includes data on smoking prevalence, cigarette consumption per smoker, and smoking-related deaths. The analysis explores how these factors have evolved over time and their relationships.

## Data Sources

The project uses several datasets, including:

- Smoking prevalence data
- Cigarette consumption per smoker data
- Smoking-related deaths data

All data sources are CSV files stored in the `csv_files` directory.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- **Code**: The R code for data analysis and data visualization.
- **csv_files**: The directory containing all the CSV data files.
- **README.md**: This README file.
